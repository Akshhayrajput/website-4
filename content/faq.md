## I was in the first round, how do I sign up again?

If you joined the Slack group in the first round, you’re already signed up! All you need to do is log in to the Slack group again.

## How is this different from the first round?

The first round followed a curriculum that went through specific chapters each week. This iteration of the group will not follow a pre-established curriculum, but instead serve as an ongoing space to ask questions and share advice related to the R for Data Science text.

## Who can join?

Anyone interested in creating and participating in a supportive, welcoming space for those learning R for data science. Specific community expectations can be found in our Code of Conduct.

## I don’t agree with the Code of Conduct

Then this is probably not the group for you.

## Where do I sign up?

You can sign up for the group here!

## When will invites go out?

The initial invites will go out on December 30th, with rolling invites approximately once a week thereafter.

## How will I receive my invite?

Look for an email from Slack, and be sure to check your spam, check your clutter, and check your inbox.

We will also send out invites via Twitter DMs if needed, so please also check your Twitter inbox and Twitter requests inbox.

If you still can’t find your invite, and it’s been over a week since signing up, please reach out to Jesse on Twitter.
